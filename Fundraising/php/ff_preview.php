							<p class="greeting">Dear Uncle Jim,</p>
							<p>I'm so excited to have the chance to participate in my schools Epic Fun Run on Wednesday, April 27th.  We are running a fun run obstacle course to show our support for the school and to help raise money to upgrade our computer lab, build new outdoor plant learning modules and for new risers on our stage.</p>
							<p>We ask family and friends to help our fundraising effort by pledging donations. Your donation will really help meet our goal and you will recieve a tax deduction letter and PledgeBids as a thank you.  As a team member in my class I'm trying to do my best to help the team. My class can earn prizes and I can too!</p>
							<p>Please sponsor me by clicking the donate button below.  This takes you to my personal fundraising page.  Thank you for your support.</p>

                                <p class="style04 color-gay03">I wanted to be a part of Waringarri media ever since early March 2013, when I took some casual work with Waringarri radio whilst waiting for my current job to open up in May 2013.  I then attended Waringarri’s AGM later that year and was nominated for a position on the board. I joined Waringarri Media’s board end of 2013 ready for 2014.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p class="style04 color-gay03">I hear Waringarri Radio is reaching more and more listeners every day and hope to see it really reach its potential and have everyone listening to our station.  I would really like to see more indigenous people  from my community becominginvolved in the media sector as it can open so many opportunities.</p>

                                <p class="style04 color-gay03">I have so far enjoyed being a small part of such a big organisation and I hope that my input, time and commitment will benefit my community and encourage more like minded young indigenous people like myself to become involved.</p>

                                <p class="style04 color-gay03">I looked forward to joining Waringarri Media’s board this year 2014 as I’ve had a fascinating interest in the world of media and had heard that new members to the board would be welcomed as it would greatly benefit our local station and our community, so as the opportunity opened up a position on the board I volunteered.</p>
                               <br>
                                <p class="style04 color-gay03">I hope to see Waringarri Radio continue to thrive into the new year, with continued community support and guidance I can see our station achieving more in the future than we could ever imagine. </p>
